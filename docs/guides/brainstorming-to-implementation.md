# Brainstorming to Implementation

Collaborative workflow for transforming vague ideas into well-defined features through structured dialogue before specification.

For well-defined requirements, skip brainstorming and use [Spec-Driven Development](./spec-driven-development.md) directly.

## When to Use

- Unclear or incomplete requirements that need refinement
- Exploring multiple approaches before committing to a direction
- New features where you know the goal but not the implementation
- Stakeholder alignment needed before detailed planning

## Plugins needed for this workflow

- [SDD](../plugins/sdd/README.md)
- [Code Review](../plugins/code-review/README.md)
- [Git](../plugins/git/README.md)
- [FPF](../plugins/fpf/README.md) (optional, for systematic hypothesis evaluation)

```

### 1. Brainstorm the idea

Use the `/sdd:brainstorm` command to start a collaborative dialogue. The LLM will explore your project context and ask clarifying questions one at a time.

```bash
/sdd:brainstorm Users want better search but requirements are unclear
```

After starting, the LLM will:

- Review your project structure, docs, and recent commits
- Ask focused questions (preferring multiple choice when possible)
- Help you define purpose, constraints, and success criteria

Answer each question to progressively refine the idea. The conversation continues until requirements are clear.

### 2. Explore approaches

Once the LLM understands your needs, it will propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs.

```md
The LLM will present options like:

**Option A: Elasticsearch Integration** (Recommended)
- Full-text search with faceting
- Trade-off: Additional infrastructure

**Option B: PostgreSQL Full-Text Search**
- No new dependencies
- Trade-off: Limited faceting capabilities

**Option C: Algolia Service**
- Fastest implementation
- Trade-off: External dependency and cost
```

After reviewing options, select your preferred approach or ask for more exploration. The LLM leads with its recommendation and explains the reasoning.

#### Using FPF for Systematic Evaluation

For architectural decisions with long-term consequences, consider using the [FPF plugin](../plugins/fpf/README.md) to systematically evaluate approaches:

```bash
/fpf:propose-hypotheses What caching strategy should we use for our API?
```

FPF provides:

- **Structured hypothesis generation** - Multiple competing options with diverse perspectives
- **Logical verification** - Check each option against project constraints
- **Evidence validation** - Empirical testing with trust scores
- **Auditable decisions** - Full reasoning trail preserved in `.fpf/` directory

**When to use FPF vs SDD brainstorming:**

| Scenario | Use FPF | Use SDD Brainstorming |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Architectural decisions with long-term impact | Yes | No |
| Multiple viable approaches needing systematic comparison | Yes | Maybe |
| Decisions requiring audit trails | Yes | No |
| Quick exploration of ideas | No | Yes |
| Easily reversible decisions | No | Yes |
| Time-critical situations | No | Yes |

See [FPF plugin documentation](../plugins/fpf/README.md) for detailed workflow steps.

### 3. Present design

The LLM presents the validated approach as a design document in 200-300 word sections, checking after each section whether it looks right.

```md
The LLM will cover:
- Architecture overview
- Component breakdown
- Data flow
- Error handling
- Testing approach
```

After each section, confirm it matches your expectations or request changes. Once complete, the design is saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

### 4. Create task and plan specification

Use the `/sdd:add-task` command to create a task file from the refined design, then `/sdd:plan` to generate a detailed specification with architecture, implementation steps, and verification criteria.

```bash
/sdd:add-task "Implement faceted search with Elasticsearch, filters, and autocomplete"
```

After LLM completes, review the task file in `.specs/tasks/draft/`. You can adjust the task file to incorporate additional details from the brainstorming session.

Then run planning to generate the full specification:

```bash
/sdd:plan
```

After LLM completes, review the refined specification in `.specs/tasks/todo/`. The plan includes architecture design, implementation steps with parallelization, and verification rubrics. You can adjust and run `/sdd:plan --refine` to iterate.

### 5. Implement features

Use the `/sdd:implement` command to execute the implementation. This produces working code with tests and verification.

```bash
/sdd:implement
```

During implementation, the LLM executes each step with quality gates, writes tests, and verifies the solution works as expected. More info in [Spec-Driven Development](./spec-driven-development.md) workflow.

### 6. Review and ship

Complete the workflow with code review and pull request creation.

```bash
/code-review:review-local-changes
/git:commit
/git:create-pr
```

After completion, your feature is ready for merge.

## Key Principles

The brainstorming phase follows these principles to ensure productive refinement:

- **One question at a time** - Focused dialogue prevents overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended questions
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always consider 2-3 approaches before committing
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each one
