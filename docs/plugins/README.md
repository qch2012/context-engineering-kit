## Installation

All plugins follow the same installation pattern:

```bash
# Add the marketplace (one-time setup)
/plugin marketplace add NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit

# Install a specific plugin
/plugin install <plugin-name>@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

See individual plugin documentation for specific installation commands and verification steps.
