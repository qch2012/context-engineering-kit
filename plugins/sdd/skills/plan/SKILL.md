# Refine Task Workflow

## Role

You are a task refinement orchestrator. Take a draft task file created by `/add-task` and refine it through a coordinated multi-agent workflow with quality gates after each phase.

## Goal

This workflow command refines an existing draft task through:

1. **Parallel Analysis** - Research, codebase analysis, and business analysis in parallel
2. **Architecture Synthesis** - Combine findings into architectural overview
3. **Decomposition** - Break into implementation steps with risks
4. **Parallelize** - Reorganize steps for maximum parallel execution
5. **Verify** - Add LLM-as-Judge verification sections
6. **Promote** - Move refined task from `draft/` to `todo/`

All phases include judge validation to prevent error propagation and ensure quality thresholds are met.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

---

## Command Arguments

Parse the following arguments from `$ARGUMENTS`:

### Argument Definitions

| Argument | Format | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `task-file` | Path to task file | **Required** | Path to draft task file (e.g., `.specs/tasks/draft/add-validation.feature.md`) |
| `--continue` | `--continue [stage]` | None | Continue refining from a specific stage. Stage is optional - resolve from context if not provided. |
| `--target-quality` | `--target-quality X.X` | `3.5` | Target threshold value (out of 5.0) for judge pass/fail decisions. |
| `--max-iterations` | `--max-iterations N` | `2` | Maximum implementation + judge retry cycles per phase before moving to next stage (regardless of pass/fail). |
| `--included-stages` | `--included-stages stage1,stage2,...` | All stages | Comma-separated list of stages to include. |
| `--excluded-stages` | `--excluded-stages stage1,stage2,...` | None | Comma-separated list of stages to exclude. |
| `--fast` | `--fast` | N/A | Alias for `--target-quality 3.0 --max-iterations 1 --included-stages business analysis,decomposition,verifications` |
| `--one-shot` | `--one-shot` | N/A | Alias for `--included-stages business analysis,decomposition --skip-judges` - minimal refinement without quality gates. |
| `--human-in-the-loop` | `--human-in-the-loop phase1,phase2,...` | None | Phases after which to pause for human verification. |
| `--skip-judges` | `--skip-judges` | `false` | Skip all judge validation checks - phases proceed without quality gates. |
| `--refine` | `--refine` | `false` | Incremental refinement mode - detect changes against git and re-run only affected stages (top-to-bottom propagation). |

### Stage Names (for `--included-stages` / `--excluded-stages`)

| Stage Name | Phase | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| `research` | 2a | Gather relevant resources, documentation, libraries |
| `codebase analysis` | 2b | Identify affected files, interfaces, integration points |
| `business analysis` | 2c | Refine description and create acceptance criteria |
| `architecture synthesis` | 3 | Synthesize research and analysis into architecture |
| `decomposition` | 4 | Break into implementation steps with risks |
| `parallelize` | 5 | Reorganize steps for parallel execution |
| `verifications` | 6 | Add LLM-as-Judge verification rubrics |

### Configuration Resolution

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and resolve configuration as follows:

```

# Extract task file path (first positional argument, required)
TASK_FILE = first argument that is a file path (must exist in .specs/tasks/draft/)

# Parse alias flags first (they set multiple defaults)
if --fast present:
    THRESHOLD = 3.0
    MAX_ITERATIONS = 1
    INCLUDED_STAGES = ["business analysis", "decomposition", "verifications"]

if --one-shot present:
    INCLUDED_STAGES = ["business analysis", "decomposition"]
    SKIP_JUDGES = true

# Initialize defaults
THRESHOLD ?= --target-quality || 3.5
MAX_ITERATIONS ?= --max-iterations || 2
INCLUDED_STAGES ?= --included-stages || ["research", "codebase analysis", "business analysis", "architecture synthesis", "decomposition", "parallelize", "verifications"]
EXCLUDED_STAGES = --excluded-stages || []
HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES = --human-in-the-loop || []
SKIP_JUDGES = --skip-judges || false
REFINE_MODE = --refine || false
CONTINUE_STAGE = null

if --continue [stage] present:
    CONTINUE_STAGE = stage or resolve from context

# Compute final active stages
ACTIVE_STAGES = INCLUDED_STAGES - EXCLUDED_STAGES
```

### Context Resolution for `--continue`

When `--continue` is used without explicit stage:

1. **Stage Resolution:**
   - Parse the task file for completion markers (e.g., `[x]` checkboxes)
   - Identify the last completed phase/judge
   - Resume from the next incomplete phase

### Refine Mode Behavior (`--refine`)

When `--refine` is used:

1. **Change Detection:**
   - First check file status: `git status --porcelain -- <TASK_FILE>`
   - Compare current task file against last git commit: `git diff HEAD -- <TASK_FILE>`
     - This captures both staged and unstaged changes vs HEAD
   - If file is untracked or has no git history, compare against the original task structure
   - Identify which sections have been modified by the user
   - Look for `//` comment markers indicating user feedback/corrections

2. **Top-to-Bottom Propagation:**
   - Determine the **earliest modified section** (highest in document)
   - Re-run only stages that correspond to or come **after** the modified section
   - Earlier stages (above the modification) are preserved as-is

3. **Section-to-Stage Mapping:**

   | Modified Section | Re-run From Stage |
   |------------------|-------------------|
   | Description / Acceptance Criteria | `business analysis` (Phase 2c) |
   | Architecture Overview | `architecture synthesis` (Phase 3) |
   | Implementation Process / Steps | `decomposition` (Phase 4) |
   | Parallelization / Dependencies | `parallelize` (Phase 5) |
   | Verification sections | `verifications` (Phase 6) |

4. **Refine Execution:**
   - Skip research (2a) and codebase analysis (2b) unless explicitly requested
   - Pass user modifications and `//` comments as additional context to agents
   - Agents should incorporate user feedback while preserving unchanged content

5. **Example:**

   ```bash
   # User edited the Architecture Overview section
   /plan .specs/tasks/todo/my-task.feature.md --refine
   
   # Detects Architecture section changed → re-runs from Phase 3 onwards
   # Skips: research, codebase analysis, business analysis
   # Runs: architecture synthesis, decomposition, parallelize, verifications
   ```

### Human-in-the-Loop Behavior

Human verification checkpoints occur:

1. **Trigger Conditions:**
   - After implementation + judge verification **PASS** for a phase in `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES`
   - After implementation + judge + implementation retry (before the next judge retry)

2. **At Checkpoint:**
   - Display current phase results summary
   - Display generated artifacts with paths
   - Display judge score and feedback
   - Ask user: "Review phase output. Continue? [Y/n/feedback]"
   - If user provides feedback, incorporate into next iteration
   - If user says "n", pause workflow

3. **Checkpoint Message Format:**

   ```markdown
   ---
   ## 🔍 Human Review Checkpoint - Phase X

   **Phase:** {phase name}
   **Judge Score:** {score}/{THRESHOLD} threshold
   **Status:** ✅ PASS / ⚠️ RETRY {n}/{MAX_ITERATIONS}

   **Artifacts:**
   - {artifact_path_1}
   - {artifact_path_2}

   **Judge Feedback:**
   {feedback summary}

   **Action Required:** Review the above artifacts and provide feedback or continue.

   > Continue? [Y/n/feedback]:
   ---
   ```

---

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Refine a draft task with all stages
/plan .specs/tasks/draft/add-validation.feature.md

# Fast refinement with minimal stages
/plan .specs/tasks/draft/quick-fix.bug.md --fast

# Continue from a specific stage
/plan .specs/tasks/draft/complex-feature.feature.md --continue decomposition

# High-quality refinement with checkpoints
/plan .specs/tasks/draft/critical-api.feature.md --target-quality 4.5 --human-in-the-loop 2,3,4,5,6

# Incremental refinement after user edits (re-runs only affected stages)
/plan .specs/tasks/todo/my-task.feature.md --refine
```

## Pre-Flight Checks

Before starting workflow:

1. **Validate task file exists:**
   - If `REFINE_MODE` is false: Check that `TASK_FILE` exists in `.specs/tasks/draft/`
   - If `REFINE_MODE` is true: Check that `TASK_FILE` exists in `.specs/tasks/todo/` or `.specs/tasks/draft/`
   - If not found, show error and exit

2. **Parse and display resolved configuration:**

   ```markdown
   ### Configuration

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | **Task File** | {TASK_FILE} |
   | **Target Quality** | {THRESHOLD}/5.0 |
   | **Max Iterations** | {MAX_ITERATIONS} |
   | **Active Stages** | {ACTIVE_STAGES as comma-separated list} |
   | **Human Checkpoints** | Phase {HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES as comma-separated} |
   | **Skip Judges** | {SKIP_JUDGES} |
   | **Refine Mode** | {REFINE_MODE} |
   | **Continue From** | {CONTINUE_STAGE} or "Start" |
   ```

3. **Handle `--continue` mode:**

   If `CONTINUE_STAGE` is set:
   - Read the task file to get current state
   - Identify completed phases from task file content
   - Skip to `CONTINUE_STAGE` (or auto-detected next incomplete stage)
   - Pre-populate captured values from existing artifacts
   - Resume workflow from the appropriate phase

4. **Handle `--refine` mode:**

   If `REFINE_MODE` is true:
   - Check file status: `git status --porcelain -- <TASK_FILE>`
     - `M` (staged) or `M` (unstaged) or `MM` (both) → proceed with diff
     - `??` (untracked) → error: "File not tracked by git, cannot detect changes"
     - Empty output → no changes detected
   - Run `git diff HEAD -- <TASK_FILE>` to get all changes (staged + unstaged) vs last commit
   - Parse diff to identify modified sections
   - Collect any `//` comment markers as user feedback
   - Determine earliest modified section using Section-to-Stage Mapping
   - Set `ACTIVE_STAGES` to include only stages from the determined starting point onwards
   - Pass detected changes and user comments as additional context to agents
   - If no changes detected, inform user: "No changes detected in task file. Edit the file first, then run --refine." and exit

5. **Extract task info from file:**
   - Read task file to extract title and type from filename
   - Parse frontmatter for title and depends_on

6. **Initialize workflow progress tracking** using TodoWrite:

   Only include todos for phases in `ACTIVE_STAGES`. If continuing, mark completed phases as `completed`.

   ```json
   {
     "todos": [
       {"content": "Ensure directories exist", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Ensuring directories exist"},
       {"content": "Phase 2a: Research relevant resources and documentation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Researching resources"},
       {"content": "Judge 2a: PASS research quality (> {THRESHOLD})", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating research"},
       {"content": "Phase 2b: Analyze codebase impact and affected files", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing codebase impact"},
       {"content": "Judge 2b: PASS codebase analysis (> {THRESHOLD})", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating codebase analysis"},
       {"content": "Phase 2c: Business analysis and acceptance criteria", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing business requirements"},
       {"content": "Judge 2c: PASS business analysis (> {THRESHOLD})", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating business analysis"},
       {"content": "Phase 3: Architecture synthesis from research and analysis", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Synthesizing architecture"},
       {"content": "Judge 3: PASS architecture synthesis (> {THRESHOLD})", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating architecture"},
       {"content": "Phase 4: Decompose into implementation steps", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Decomposing into steps"},
       {"content": "Judge 4: PASS decomposition (> {THRESHOLD})", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating decomposition"},
       {"content": "Phase 5: Parallelize implementation steps", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Parallelizing steps"},
       {"content": "Judge 5: PASS parallelization (> {THRESHOLD})", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating parallelization"},
       {"content": "Phase 6: Define verification rubrics", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Defining verifications"},
       {"content": "Judge 6: PASS verifications (> {THRESHOLD})", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating verifications"},
       {"content": "Move task to todo folder", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Promoting task"},
       {"content": "Human checkpoint reviews", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Awaiting human review"}
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Note:** Filter todos based on configuration:
   - If `SKIP_JUDGES` is true, omit ALL Judge todos (Judge 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4, 5, 6)
   - If `research` not in `ACTIVE_STAGES`, omit Phase 2a and Judge 2a todos
   - If `codebase analysis` not in `ACTIVE_STAGES`, omit Phase 2b and Judge 2b todos
   - If `business analysis` not in `ACTIVE_STAGES`, omit Phase 2c and Judge 2c todos
   - If `architecture synthesis` not in `ACTIVE_STAGES`, omit Phase 3 and Judge 3 todos
   - If `decomposition` not in `ACTIVE_STAGES`, omit Phase 4 and Judge 4 todos
   - If `parallelize` not in `ACTIVE_STAGES`, omit Phase 5 and Judge 5 todos
   - If `verifications` not in `ACTIVE_STAGES`, omit Phase 6 and Judge 6 todos
   - If `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES` is empty, omit human checkpoint todo

7. **Ensure directories exist**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .specs/tasks/todo .specs/tasks/in-progress .specs/tasks/done .specs/analysis .specs/scratchpad .claude/skills
   ```

Update each todo to `in_progress` when starting a phase and `completed` when judge passes.

## CRITICAL

- Do not mark PASS for any judge if it did not pass the rubric. Retry the judge after each implementation change till it passes the check!
- Do not read task files in .claude or .specs directories, your job is orchestrate agents that will do the work, not do it by yourself!
- Use `THRESHOLD` (default 3.5) for all judge pass/fail decisions, not hardcoded values!
- Use `MAX_ITERATIONS` (default 2) for retry limits, not hardcoded values!
- **After `MAX_ITERATIONS` reached: PROCEED to next stage automatically - do NOT ask user unless phase is in `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES`!**
- Skip phases not in `ACTIVE_STAGES` entirely - do not launch agents for excluded stages!
- Trigger human-in-the-loop checkpoints ONLY after phases in `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES`!
- **If `SKIP_JUDGES` is true: Skip ALL judge validation - proceed directly to next phase after each implementation phase completes!**
- **Task file must exist in `.specs/tasks/draft/` before running this command (unless `--refine` mode)!**
- **If `REFINE_MODE` is true: Detect changes via git diff, skip unchanged stages, pass user feedback to agents!**

## Workflow Execution

You MUST launch for each step a separate agent, instead of performing all steps yourself.

**CRITICAL:** For each agent you MUST:

1. Use the **Agent** type and **Model** specified in the step
2. Provide the task file path and user input as context
3. Require agent to implement exactly that step, not more, not less
4. After each sub-phase, launch a judge agent to validate quality before proceeding

### Complete Workflow Overview

**Note:** Phases not in `ACTIVE_STAGES` are skipped. If `SKIP_JUDGES` is true, all judge steps are skipped entirely. Human checkpoints (🔍) occur after phases in
`HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES`.

## Phase 2: Parallel Analysis

Phase 2 launches three analysis phases in parallel, each with its own judge validation.

### Phase 2a/2b/2c: Parallel Sub-Phases

Launch these three phases **in parallel** immediately:

---

#### Phase 2a: Research

**Model:** `sonnet`
**Agent:** `researcher`
**Depends on:** Task file exists
**Purpose:** Gather relevant resources, documentation, libraries, and prior art. Creates or updates a reusable skill.

Launch agent:

- **Description**: "Research task resources and create/update skill"
- **Prompt**:

  ```
  Task File: <TASK_FILE>
  Task Title: <title from task file>

  CRITICAL: DO NOT OUTPUT YOUR RESEARCH, ONLY CREATE THE SCRATCHPAD AND SKILL FILE.
  ```

**Capture:**

- Skill file path (e.g., `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`)
- Skill action (Created new / Updated existing)
- Scratchpad file path (e.g., `.specs/scratchpad/<hex-id>.md`)
- Number of resources gathered
- Key recommendation summary

CRITICAL: If expected files not created, launch the agent again with the same prompt.

---

#### Phase 2b: Codebase Impact Analysis

**Model:** `sonnet`
**Agent:** `code-explorer`
**Depends on:** Task file exists
**Purpose:** Identify affected files, interfaces, and integration points

Launch agent:

- **Description**: "Analyze codebase impact"
- **Prompt**:

  ```text
  Task File: <TASK_FILE>
  Task Title: <title from task file>

  CRITICAL: DO NOT OUTPUT YOUR ANALYSIS, ONLY CREATE THE SCRATCHPAD AND ANALYSIS FILE.
  ```

**Capture:**

- Analysis file path (e.g., `.specs/analysis/analysis-{name}.md`)
- Scratchpad file path (e.g., `.specs/scratchpad/<hex-id>.md`)
- Files affected count (modify/create/delete)
- Risk level assessment
- Key integration points

CRITICAL: If expected files not created, launch the agent again with the same prompt.

---

#### Phase 2c: Business Analysis

**Model:** `opus`
**Agent:** `business-analyst`
**Depends on:** Task file exists
**Purpose:** Refine description and create acceptance criteria

Launch agent:

- **Description**: "Business analysis"
- **Prompt**:

  ```
  Read .claude/prompts/analyse-business-requirements.md and execute it exactly as is!

  Task File: <TASK_FILE>
  Task Title: <title from task file>

  CRITICAL: DO NOT OUTPUT YOUR BUSINESS ANALYSIS, ONLY CREATE THE SCRATCHPAD AND UPDATE THE TASK FILE.
  ```

**Capture:**

- Scratchpad file path (e.g., `.specs/scratchpad/<hex-id>.md`)
- Acceptance criteria count
- Scope defined (yes/no)
- User scenarios documented

---

### Judge 2a/2b/2c: Validate Parallel Phases

After **each** parallel phase completes, launch its respective judge **with the same agent type and model**.

### Artifacts Generated

```

.claude/
└── skills/
    └── <skill-name>/
        └── SKILL.md             # Reusable skill document (if research stage ran)

```

### Task Status Management

Task status is managed by folder location:
- `draft/` - Tasks created but not yet refined
- `todo/` - Tasks ready for implementation
- `in-progress/` - Tasks currently being worked on
- `done/` - Completed tasks

### Next Steps

1. Review task: `.specs/tasks/todo/<filename>`
   - Edit the task file directly to make corrections
   - Add `//` comments to lines that need clarification or changes
   - Run `/plan` again with `--refine` to incorporate your feedback — it detects changes against git and propagates updates **top-to-bottom** (editing a section only affects sections below it, not above)
2. If everything is fine, begin implementation: `/implement` (will auto-select the task from todo/)
```

---

## Error Handling

### Phase Agent Failure (Exception/Crash)

If any phase agent fails unexpectedly:

1. Report the failure with agent output
2. Ask clarification questions from user that can help resolve the issue
3. Launch the phase agent again with list of questions and answers to resolve the issue

### Judge Returns FAIL

If any judge returns FAIL (score < `THRESHOLD`):

1. **Automatic retry**: Re-launch the phase agent with judge feedback
2. **Human-in-the-loop check**: If phase is in `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES`, trigger human checkpoint **before** the next judge retry (after implementation retry but before re-judging)
3. **After `MAX_ITERATIONS` reached**: **Proceed to next stage automatically** (do NOT ask user unless `--human-in-the-loop` includes this phase)
4. Log warning in completion summary: `⚠️ Phase X did not pass quality threshold (X.X/THRESHOLD) after MAX_ITERATIONS iterations`

### Retry Flow

```
Implementation → Judge FAIL → Implementation Retry → Judge Retry
                                                          ↓
                              PASS → Continue to next stage
                              FAIL → Repeat until MAX_ITERATIONS
                                          ↓
                              MAX_ITERATIONS reached → Proceed to next stage (with warning)
```

### Retry Flow with Human-in-the-Loop

When phase is in `HUMAN_IN_THE_LOOP_PHASES`:

```
Implementation → Judge FAIL → Implementation Retry
                                    ↓
                    🔍 Human Checkpoint (optional feedback)
                                    ↓
                              Judge Retry
                                    ↓
                    PASS → Continue | FAIL → Repeat until MAX_ITERATIONS
                                                    ↓
                              MAX_ITERATIONS → 🔍 Final Human Checkpoint
                                                    ↓
                                    User confirms → Proceed to next stage
```
