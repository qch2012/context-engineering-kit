# Business Analysis Scratchpad: Convert Git Plugin Skills to Codex Format

Task: `convert-git-to-codex.md`
Created: 2026-02-16

## Phase 1: Requirements Discovery

### Task Overview
- Initial User Prompt: Convert Git plugin skills from Claude format to Codex format.
- Current Description: One-to-one migration of 10 skill files with compatibility rewrites.
- Task Type: Refactor/migration
- Complexity: L

### Problem Definition (Step-by-Step Analysis)
Step 1: Surface request
- Convert 10 `SKILL.md` files into Codex-compatible format.

Step 2: True objective
- Preserve skill behavior while removing Claude-only metadata/invocation syntax.

Step 3: Business value
- Enables same Git skill set to run in Codex workflows with lower maintenance.

Step 4: Beneficiaries
- Plugin maintainers (single migration contract) and users (stable command aliases).

Step 5: Future extensions
- Repo-wide converter automation.
- Shared validator for all plugin skill migrations.

Step 6: Constraints
- Strict mapping and naming rules.
- No scope creep beyond `plugins/git`.

Therefore, the root problem is:
- Existing Git skills are coupled to Claude-specific schema and must be normalized for Codex without behavioral drift.

### Scope
- Included: 10 mapped conversions, frontmatter rewrite, body compatibility rewrite, validation checks.
- Excluded: Non-git plugins, runtime changes, CI integration.

### Ambiguous Areas
- Exact description phrasing after argument-hint merge.
- Treatment of `Skill(...)` references in prose.

## Phase 2: Concept Extraction
- Actors: plugin maintainer, Codex user.
- Actions: read source skill, transform frontmatter/body, validate output.
- Entities: source skills, target skills, mapping table, forbidden-token list.
- Constraints: deterministic naming, no forbidden syntax, alias suffix contract.

## Phase 3: Requirements Analysis
- Hard requirements are objective and testable via text scans.
- Quality risks are mostly content-consistency issues in long markdown files.

## Phase 4: Draft Output
- Drafted description, acceptance criteria, architecture pipeline, and 6-step implementation plan.

## Self-Critique
- Criteria are measurable.
- Dependencies and parallel opportunities are explicit.
- Additional guardrail: require final global sweep before completion report.
