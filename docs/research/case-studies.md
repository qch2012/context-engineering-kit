- Specific examples or anecdotes
- Screenshots or output samples (if applicable)

**Lessons Learned**:
- What worked well
- What didn't work as expected
- Recommendations for others
- Ideas for future improvements

**Metadata**:

## Contributing Case Studies

We welcome case studies from the community! Your experiences help others understand how to effectively use these plugins.

### How to Contribute

1. **Prepare Your Case Study**:
   - Use the template above
   - Include concrete details and metrics when possible
   - Focus on insights that will help others
   - Anonymize sensitive project details if necessary

2. **Submit Your Case Study**:
   - **Option A**: Open a Pull Request adding your case study to this file
   - **Option B**: Open a GitHub Issue with your case study content
   - **Option C**: Share via community channels (Discord, discussions)

3. **Review Process**:
   - Maintainers will review for clarity and completeness
   - May ask clarifying questions or suggest edits
   - Once approved, your case study will be added to this document

### What Makes a Good Case Study

**Good Case Studies Include**:
- Specific, measurable outcomes
- Clear description of approach and workflow
- Honest assessment (both successes and challenges)
- Actionable lessons learned
- Context that helps others assess applicability

**Less Helpful**:
- Vague descriptions without specifics
- Only positive outcomes without challenges
- Missing context about the project or team
- Claims without supporting evidence

### Privacy and Confidentiality

You may:
- Anonymize company names, project details, or client information
- Use approximate numbers if exact metrics are confidential
- Describe approaches without revealing proprietary details

The goal is sharing knowledge, not disclosing sensitive information.

## Case Study Categories

As case studies are added, they will be organized into categories:

### By Plugin
- Reflexion only
- Code Review only
- Spec-Driven Development only
- Multiple plugins combined

### By Project Type
- Web applications
- APIs and microservices
- CLI tools
- Libraries and frameworks
- Data pipelines
- Mobile applications

### By Team Context
- Solo developers
- Small teams (2-5)
- Medium teams (6-20)
- Large organizations (20+)

### By Outcome Focus
- Quality improvements
- Time efficiency
- Learning and skill development
- Codebase maintainability
- Bug reduction
- Developer experience

## Research Opportunities

Case studies also serve as valuable data for understanding:
- Which techniques work best in which contexts
- How improvements scale with team size and project complexity
- What adaptations practitioners make to published techniques
- Which combinations of plugins provide synergistic benefits

If you're interested in collaborating on research based on case study data, please reach out via GitHub Discussions.

## Example Case Study Outline

To give you an idea of what a complete case study might look like, here's a detailed outline:

### Case Study: Improving Code Review Quality in NestJS Microservices

**Context**:
- E-commerce platform with 12 NestJS microservices
- Team of 8 developers (4 senior, 4 junior)
- Frequent bugs in production due to missed edge cases
- PR reviews taking 2-3 hours each, still missing issues

**Approach**:
- Installed Code Review plugin for all PRs
- Used `/code-review:review-pr` before human review
- Focused on bug-hunter and test-coverage-reviewer agents
- Integrated findings into PR comments for human reviewers
- After 2 weeks, added Reflexion plugin for `/reflexion:memorize`

**Results**:
- 40% reduction in production bugs over 3 months
- PR review time reduced to 1-1.5 hours (25-50% improvement)
- Junior developers learned from agent feedback
- 15 critical security issues caught that humans missed
- Team documented common patterns in CLAUDE.md via memorize

**Specific Examples**:
1. Bug-hunter identified race condition in payment processing
2. Test-coverage-reviewer suggested edge case for inventory < 0
3. Security-auditor flagged SQL injection vulnerability in logging
4. Memorize command captured "always validate currency codes" principle

**Lessons Learned**:
- Running automated review before human review most effective
- Bug-hunter and test-coverage agents provided most value
- Human reviewers focused on architecture instead of bugs
- Memorize command built institutional knowledge over time
- Initial skepticism from team; converted after catching first critical bug

**Recommendations**:
- Start with code-review alone before adding other plugins
- Focus human reviewers on what agents can't evaluate well
- Regularly review and curate CLAUDE.md memory
- Use agent findings as teaching moments for junior developers

**Metadata**:
- Date: October 2024 - January 2025
- Plugins Used: Code Review, Reflexion
- Project Duration: 3 months ongoing
- Team Size: 8 developers
- Technology: NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL

## Upcoming Case Studies

We're currently collecting case studies for:
- Using Reflexion for iterative documentation improvement
- Spec-Driven Development for greenfield projects
- Kaizen analysis for debugging complex production issues
- Customizing plugins for domain-specific needs

If you're working on any of these scenarios, we'd love to hear about your experience!
