# kaizen - Continuous Improvement Skill

Automatically applied skill guiding continuous improvement mindset, error-proofing, standardized work, and just-in-time principles.

## The Four Pillars of Kaizen

The Kaizen skill applies continuous improvement principles automatically during development:

1. Continuous Improvement - Small, frequent improvements compound into major gains. Always leave code better than you found it.
2. Poka-Yoke (Error Proofing) - Design systems that prevent errors at compile/design time, not runtime. Make invalid states unrepresentable.
3. Standardized Work - Follow established patterns. Document what works. Make good practices easy to follow.
4. Just-In-Time (JIT) - Build what's needed now. No "just in case" features. Avoid premature optimization.


## Theoretical Foundation

The Kaizen skill is based on methodologies with over 70 years of real-world validation in manufacturing, now adapted for software development:

### Toyota Production System (TPS)

The foundation of Lean manufacturing, developed at Toyota starting in the 1940s:

- **[The Toyota Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way)** - 14 principles of continuous improvement and respect for people
- **[Toyota Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Kata)** - Scientific thinking routines for improvement (PDCA)
- **Proven Results**: Toyota achieved highest quality ratings while reducing production costs by 50%+

### Lean Manufacturing Principles

- **[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)** - Philosophy of continuous improvement through small, incremental changes
- **[Muda (Waste)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term))** - Seven types of waste to eliminate
- **[Value Stream Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping)** - Visualizing process flow to identify improvement opportunities
- **Industry Impact**: Lean principles have spread to healthcare, software, services, achieving **20-50% efficiency improvements**
