# [Context Engineering Kit](https://cek.neolab.finance)

Hand-crafted collection of advanced context engineering techniques and patterns with minimal token footprint, focused on improving agent result quality and predictability.

The marketplace is based on prompts used daily by our company developers for a long time, while adding plugins from benchmarked papers and high-quality projects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **v2 marketplace release:** [Spec-Driven Development plugin](https://cek.neolab.finance/plugins/sdd) was rewritten from sctratch. It is now able to produce working code in 100% of cases on real-life production projects!

## Key Features

- **Simple to Use** - Easy to install and use without any dependencies. Contains automatically used skills and self-explanatory commands.
- **Token-Efficient** - Carefully crafted prompts and architecture, preferring command oriented skills with sub-agents over general information skills when possible, to minimize populating context with unnecessary information.
- **Quality-Focused** - Each plugin is focused on meaningfully improving agent results in a specific area.
- **Granular** - Install only the plugins you need. Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills. Each without overlap and redundant skills.
- **Scientifically proven** - Plugins are based on proven techniques and patterns that were tested by well-trusted benchmarks and studies.
- **Open-Standards** - Skills are based on [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) and [openskills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills). [SDD](https://cek.neolab.finance/plugins/sdd) plugin is based on Arc42 specification standard for software development documentation.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Marketplaces and Plugin

#### Claude Code

Open Claude Code and add the Context Engineering Kit marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

This makes all plugins available for installation, but does not load any agents or skills into your context.

Install any plugins, for example reflexion

```bash
/plugin install reflexion@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

Each installed plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills into Claude's context.

<details>
<summary>Installation for Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, OpenCode and others</summary>

Use [OpenSkills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) to install skills for broad range of agents:

```bash
npx openskills install NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
npx openskills sync
```

</details>

### Step 2: Use Plugin

```bash
> claude "implement user authentication"
# Claude implements user authentication, then you can ask it to reflect on implementation

> /reflexion:reflect
# It analyses results and suggests improvements
# If issues are obvious, it will fix them immediately
# If they are minor, it will suggest improvements that you can respond to
> fix the issues

# If you would like it to avoid issues that were found during reflection to appear again,
# ask claude to extract resolution strategies and save the insights to project memory
> /reflexion:memorize
```

Alternatively, you can use the `reflect` word in the initial prompt:

```bash
> claude "implement user authentication, then reflect"
# Claude implements user authentication,
# then hook automatically runs /reflexion:reflect
```

In order to use this hook, you need to have `bun` installed. However, it is not required for the overall command.

## Documentation

You can find the complete Context Engineering Kit documentation [here](https://cek.neolab.finance).

But main plugin we recommend to start with is [Spec-Driven Development](https://cek.neolab.finance/plugins/sdd).

## [Spec-Driven Development](https://cek.neolab.finance/plugins/sdd)

Comprehensive specification-driven development workflow plugin that transforms prompts into production-ready implementations through structured planning, architecture design, and quality-gated execution.

This plugin is designed to consistently and reproducibly produce working code. It was tested on real-life production projects by our team, and in 100% of cases it generated working code aligned with the initial prompt. If you find a use case it cannot handle, please report it as an issue.

#### Key Features

- **Development as compilation** — The plugin works like a "compilation" or "nightly build" for your development process: `task specs → run /sdd:implement → working code`. After writing your prompt, you can launch the plugin and expect a working result when you come back. The time it takes depends on task complexity — simple tasks may finish in 30 minutes, while complex ones can take a few days.
- **Benchmark-level quality in real life** — Model benchmarks improve with each release, yet real-world results usually stay the same. That's because benchmarks reflect the best possible output a model can achieve, whereas in practice LLMs tend to drift toward sub-optimal solutions that can be wrong or non-functional. This plugin uses a variety of patterns to keep the model working at its peak performance.
- **Customizable** — Balance between result quality and process speed by adjusting command parameters. Learn more in the [Customization](./customization.md) section.
- **Developer time-efficient** — The overall process is designed to minimize developer time and reduce the number of interactions, while still producing results better than what a model can generate from scratch. However, overall quality is highly proportional to the time you invest in iterating and refining the specification.
- **Industry-standard** — The plugin's specification template is based on the arc42 standard, adjusted for LLM capabilities. Arc42 is a widely adopted, high-quality standard for software development documentation used by many companies and organizations.
- **Works best in complex or large codebases** — While most other frameworks work best for new projects and greenfield development, this plugin is designed to perform better the more existing code and well-structured architecture you have. At each planning phase it includes a **codebase impact analysis** step that evaluates which files may be affected and which patterns to follow to achieve the desired result.
- **Simple** — This plugin avoids unnecessary complexity and mainly uses just 3 commands, offloading process complexity to the model via multi-agent orchestration. `/sdd:implement` is a single command that produces working code from a task specification. To create that specification, you run `/sdd:add-task` and `/sdd:plan`, which analyze your prompt and iteratively refine the specification until it meets the required quality.

#### Quick Start

```bash
/plugin install sdd@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

Then run the following commands:

```bash
# create .specs/tasks/draft/design-auth-middleware.feature.md file with initial prompt
/sdd:add-task "Design and implement authentication middleware with JWT support"

# write detailed specification for the task
/sdd:plan
# will move task to .specs/tasks/todo/ folder
```

Restart the Claude Code session to clear context and start fresh. Then run the following command:

```bash
# implement the task
/sdd:implement @.specs/tasks/todo/design-auth-middleware.feature.md
# produces working implementation and moves the task to .specs/tasks/done/ folder
```

### [FPF - First Principles Framework](https://cek.neolab.finance/plugins/fpf)

A structured reasoning plugin that implements the **[First Principles Framework (FPF)](https://github.com/ailev/FPF)** by Anatoly Levenchuk — a methodology for rigorous, auditable reasoning. The killer feature is turning the black box of AI reasoning into a transparent, evidence-backed audit trail. The plugin makes AI decision-making transparent and auditable. Instead of jumping to solutions, FPF enforces generating competing hypotheses, checking them logically, testing against evidence, then letting developers choose.

Key principles:

- **Transparent reasoning** - Full audit trail from hypothesis to decision
- **Hypothesis-driven** - Generate 3-5 competing alternatives before evaluating
- **Evidence-based** - Computed trust scores, not estimates
- **Human-in-the-loop** - AI generates options; humans decide (Transformer Mandate)

The core cycle follows three modes of inference:

1. **Abduction** — Generate competing hypotheses (don't anchor on the first idea).
2. **Deduction** — Verify logic and constraints (does the idea make sense?).
3. **Induction** — Gather evidence through tests or research (does the idea work in reality?).

Then, audit for bias, decide, and document the rationale in a durable record.

> **Warning:** This plugin loads the core FPF specification into context, which is large (~600k tokens). As a result, it is loaded into a subagent with the Sonnet[1m] model. However, such an agent can consume your token limit quickly.

**How to install**

```bash
/plugin install fpf@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

#### Usage workflow

```bash
# Execute complete FPF cycle from hypothesis to decision
/fpf:propose-hypotheses What caching strategy should we use?

# The workflow will:
# 1. Initialize context and .fpf/ directory
# 2. Generate competing hypotheses
# 3. Allow you to add your own alternatives
# 4. Verify each against project constraints (parallel)
# 5. Validate with evidence (parallel)
# 6. Compute trust scores (parallel)
# 7. Present comparison for your decision
```
