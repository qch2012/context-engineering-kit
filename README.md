[![Mentioned in Awesome Claude Code](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code)

# [Context Engineering Kit](https://cek.neolab.finance)

Hand-crafted collection of advanced context engineering techniques and patterns with minimal token footprint, focused on improving agent result quality.

The Claude Code plugin marketplace is based on prompts used daily by our company developers for a long time, while adding plugins from benchmarked papers and high-quality projects.

## Key Features

- **Simple to Use** - Easy to install and use without any dependencies. Contains automatically used skills and self-explanatory commands.
- **Token-Efficient** - Carefully crafted prompts and architecture, preferring commands with sub-agents over skills when possible, to minimize populating context with unnecessary information.
- **Quality-Focused** - Each plugin is focused on meaningfully improving agent results in a specific area.
- **Granular** - Install only the plugins you need. Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills. Each without overlap and redundant skills.
- **Scientifically proven** - Plugins are based on proven techniques and patterns that were tested by well-trusted benchmarks and studies.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

Open Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

Add the Context Engineering Kit marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

This makes all plugins available for installation, but does not load any agents or skills into your context.

### Step 2: Install Plugin

Install any plugins, for example reflexion

```bash
/plugin install reflexion@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

Each installed plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills into Claude's context.

### Step 3: Use Plugin

```bash
# Include in your prompt "reflect" word
> claude "implement user authentication, then reflect"

# Claude implements user authentication, then automatically runs /reflexion:reflect
# It analyses results and suggests improvements
# If issues are obvious, it will fix them immediately
# If they are minor, it will suggest improvements that you can respond to
> fix the issues

# If you would like it to avoid issues that were found during reflection to appear again, 
# ask claude to extract resolution strategies and save the insights to project memory
> /reflexion:memorize
```

Alternatively, you can use the `/reflexion:reflect` command directly:

```bash
> claude "fix the bug"
# Claude fixes the bug

> /reflexion:reflect
# It will reflect on the bug fix and try to resolve found issues.
```

### Reflexion

Collection of commands that force the LLM to reflect on previous response and output. Includes **automatic reflection hooks** that trigger when you include "reflect" in your prompt.

**How to install**

```bash
/plugin install reflexion@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

**Commands**

- `/reflexion:reflect` - Reflect on previous response and output, based on Self-refinement framework for iterative improvement with complexity triage and verification
- `/reflexion:memorize` - Memorize insights from reflections and update the CLAUDE.md file with this knowledge. Curates insights from reflections and critiques into CLAUDE.md using Agentic Context Engineering
- `/reflexion:critique` - Comprehensive multi-perspective review using specialized judges with debate and consensus building

**Hooks**

- **Automatic Reflection Hook** - Triggers `/reflexion:reflect` automatically when "reflect" appears in your prompt

#### Based on papers

Based on papers like [Self-Refine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651) and [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366). These techniques improve the output of large language models by introducing feedback and refinement loops.

They are proven to **increase output quality by 8–21%** based on both automatic metrics and human preferences across seven diverse tasks, including dialogue generation, coding, and mathematical reasoning, when compared to standard one-step model outputs.

Full list of included patterns and techniques:

- [Self-Refinement / Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651) - One model generates, then reviews and improves its own output
- [Constitutional AI (CAI) / RLAIF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) - One model generates responses, another critiques them based on principles
- [Critic-Generator or Verifier-Generator Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14660v1) - Generator model creates outputs, Critic/verifier model evaluates and provides feedback
- [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) - One LLM evaluates/scores outputs from another LLM
- [Debate / Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325) - Multiple models propose and critique solutions
- [Generate-Verify-Refine (GVR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05511) - Three-stage process: generate → verify → refine based on verification

On top of that, the plugin is based on the [Agentic Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618) paper that uses memory updates after reflection, and **consistently outperforms strong baselines by 10.6%** on agents.

Also includes the following techniques:

- [Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495) - Model generates answer, then verification questions, then revises
- [Tree of Thoughts (ToT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) - Explores multiple reasoning paths with evaluation
- [Process Reward Models (PRM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20050) - Evaluates reasoning steps rather than just final answers

### Code Review

Comprehensive code review commands using multiple specialized agents for thorough code quality evaluation.

**How to install**

```bash
/plugin install code-review@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

**Commands**

- `/code-review:review-local-changes` - Comprehensive review of local uncommitted changes using specialized agents with code improvement suggestions
- `/code-review:review-pr` - Comprehensive pull request review using specialized agents

**Agents**

This plugin uses multiple specialized agents for comprehensive code quality analysis:

- **bug-hunter** - Identifies potential bugs, edge cases, and error-prone patterns
- **code-quality-reviewer** - Evaluates code structure, readability, and maintainability
- **contracts-reviewer** - Reviews interfaces, API contracts, and data models
- **historical-context-reviewer** - Analyzes changes in relation to codebase history and patterns
