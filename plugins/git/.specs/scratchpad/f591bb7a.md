# Planning + Verification Scratchpad: Convert Git Plugin Skills to Codex Format

Task: `convert-git-to-codex.md`
Created: 2026-02-16

## Decomposition Draft
1. Create target directory tree.
2. Build source metadata inventory.
3. Convert 8 command skills.
4. Convert 2 knowledge skills.
5. Run normalization and compatibility sweep.
6. Publish final validation report.

## Dependency Model
- Step 1 -> Step 2
- Step 2 -> Step 3 and Step 4 in parallel
- Step 3 + Step 4 -> Step 5 -> Step 6

## Verification Design
- Step 2: single quality check (inventory correctness)
- Step 3/4: per-file quality checks
- Step 5: panel-level global check
- Step 6: completion-report accuracy check

## Judge Rubric Anchors
- Coverage/completeness
- Compatibility cleanup accuracy
- Naming and alias consistency
- Preservation fidelity

## Pass Threshold Policy
- All scored checks must be >= 4.0/5.0
- Any critical compatibility failure blocks completion
