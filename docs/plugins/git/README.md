# Git Plugin

Commands for streamlined Git operations including commits and pull request creation with conventional commit messages.

## Plugin Target

- Maintain consistent commit history - Every commit follows conventional commit format
- Reduce PR creation friction - Automated formatting, templates, and linking
- Improve issue-to-code workflow - Clear technical specs from issue descriptions
- Ensure team consistency - Standardized Git operations across the team

## Overview

The Git plugin provides commands that automate and standardize Git workflows, ensuring consistent commit messages, proper PR formatting, and efficient issue management. It integrates GitHub best practices and conventional commits with emoji.

Most commands require GitHub CLI (`gh`) for full functionality including creating PRs, loading issues, and setting labels/reviewers.

> /git:create-pr
```

#### Analyze Open GitHub issues

```bash
# Load all open issues
> /git:load-issues
