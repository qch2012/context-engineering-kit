# Overview

Welcome to the Context Engineering Kit documentation. This section provides a comprehensive introduction to the marketplace, its philosophy, architecture, and scientific foundations.

## What You'll Learn

This overview section covers:

- **[What is Context Engineering Kit](./what-is-cek.md)** - Understand the mission, philosophy, and approach behind CEK
- **[Key Features](./key-features.md)** - Explore the five core principles that make CEK unique and effective
- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** - Learn how the plugin system works and how commands, skills, and agents are loaded
- **[Scientific Basis](./scientific-basis.md)** - Discover the research, papers, and benchmarks that validate CEK's techniques

## Quick Overview

The Context Engineering Kit is a hand-crafted collection of advanced context engineering techniques and patterns with a minimal token footprint, focused on improving agent result quality. Built on techniques proven through research and battle-tested in production environments, CEK provides a modular, scientific approach to enhancing Claude Code's capabilities.

### Core Philosophy

CEK is built on five foundational principles: **Simple to Use**, **Token-Efficient**, **Quality-Focused**, **Granular**, and **Scientifically Proven**. For detailed explanations of each principle, see [Key Features](./key-features.md).
