# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Plugin

A disciplined approach to software development that ensures every line of production code is validated by tests written first. Introduces TDD methodology, anti-pattern detection, and orchestrated test coverage using specialized agents.

Focused on:

- **Test-first development** - Write tests before implementation, ensuring every feature is verified
- **Red-Green-Refactor cycle** - Systematic approach that builds confidence through failing tests
- **Anti-pattern detection** - Identifies common testing mistakes like mock abuse and test-only methods
- **Agent-orchestrated coverage** - Parallel test writing using specialized subagents for complex changes

## Plugin Target

- **Prevent regressions** - Every change is backed by tests that catch future breaks
- **Improve design quality** - Hard-to-test code reveals design problems early
- **Build confidence** - Watching tests fail then pass proves they actually test something
- **Accelerate development** - TDD is faster than debugging untested code in production

## Overview

The TDD plugin implements Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development methodology, proven over two decades to produce higher-quality, more maintainable software. The core principle is simple but transformative: **write the test first, watch it fail, then write minimal code to pass**.

The plugin is based on foundational works including Kent Beck's *Test-Driven Development: By Example* and the extensive research on TDD effectiveness.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the plugin
/plugin install tdd@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit

> claude "Use TDD skill to implement email validation for user registration"

# Manually make some changes that cause test failures

# Fix failing tests
> /tdd:fix-tests
```

### After Implementation

If you implemented a new feature but have not written tests, you can use the `write-tests` command to cover it.

```bash
> claude "implement email validation for user registration"

# Write tests after you made changes
> /tdd:write-tests
```

[Usage Examples](./usage-examples.md)

## Commands

- [/write-tests](./write-tests.md) - Systematically add test coverage for all local code changes using specialized review and development agents
- [/fix-tests](./fix-tests.md) - Systematically fix all failing tests after business logic changes or refactoring using orchestrated agents.
