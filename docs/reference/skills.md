# Skill Reference

Complete alphabetical index of all skills available across Context Engineering Kit plugins.

## Skills by Plugin

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Testing-first development methodology with Red-Green-Refactor cycle. [More info](../plugins/tdd/README.md).

- `test-driven-development` - Introduces TDD methodology, best practices, and skills for testing using subagents.

### Subagent-Driven Development (SADD)

Multi-agent task orchestration with quality gates between tasks. [More info](../plugins/sadd/README.md).

- `subagent-driven-development` - Dispatches fresh subagent for each task with code review between tasks, enabling fast iteration with quality gates.
- `multi-agent-patterns` - Design multi-agent architectures (supervisor/orchestrator, peer-to-peer/swarm, hierarchical) for complex tasks exceeding single-agent context limits.

### Domain-Driven Development (DDD)

Architecture and design principles for maintainable software. [More info](../plugins/ddd/README.md).

- `software-architecture` - Includes Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and other design patterns.

### Kaizen

Continuous improvement methodology with multiple analysis techniques. [More info](../plugins/kaizen/README.md).

- `kaizen` - Japanese continuous improvement philosophy with root cause analysis, Five Whys, PDCA cycles, and lean practices.

### Git

Streamlined Git operations with advanced workflow patterns. [More info](../plugins/git/README.md).

- `worktrees` - Use when working on multiple branches simultaneously, context switching without stashing, reviewing PRs while developing, testing in isolation, or comparing implementations across branches.
- `notes` - Use when adding metadata to commits without changing history, tracking review status, test results, code quality annotations, or supplementing commit messages post-hoc.

### Customaize Agent

Prompt engineering techniques and patterns for creating effective extensions. [More info](../plugins/customaize-agent/README.md).

- `prompt-engineering` - Well-known prompt engineering techniques and patterns, includes Anthropic Best Practices and Agent Persuasion Principles.
- `context-engineering` - Deep understanding of context mechanics in agent systems: attention budget, progressive disclosure, lost-in-middle effect, and practical optimization patterns.
- `agent-evaluation` - Evaluation frameworks for agent systems including LLM-as-Judge techniques, multi-dimensional rubrics, bias mitigation, and the 95% performance finding.
