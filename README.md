# Context Engineering Kit

Hand-crafted collection of advanced context engineering techniques and patterns with minimal token footprint focused on improving agent result quality.

Claude Code plugin marketplace is based on prompts used daily by our company developers for a long time, while adding plugins from benchmarked papers and high-quality projects.

## Key Features

- **Simple to Use** - Easy to install and use without any dependencies. Contains automatically used skills and self-explanatory commands.
- **Token-Efficient** - Carefully crafted prompts and architecture, preferring commands over skills, to minimize populating context with unnecessary information.
- **Quality-Focused** - Each plugin is focused on meaningfully improving agent results in a specific area.
- **Granular** - Install only the plugins you need. Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills. Each without overlap and redundant skills.
- **Scientifically proven** - Plugins are based on proven techniques and patterns that were tested by well-trusted benchmarks and studies.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

Open Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

Add the Context Engineering Kit marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

This makes all plugins available for installation, but does not load any agents or skills into your context.

### Step 2: Install Plugin

Install any plugins, for example reflexion

```bash
/plugin install reflexion@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

Each installed plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills into Claude's context.

### Step 3: Use Plugin

```bash
# start claude code
> claude "suggest how to improve codebase"

# Reflect on previous response and improve it if needed
> /reflexion:reflect

# Identify issues and strategies to solve them, and update CLAUDE.md with this knowledge
> /reflexion:memorize
```

## Update Marketplace

To get the latest plugin listings and updates from the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

### Reflexion

Collection of commands that force LLM to reflect on previous response and output.

**How to install**

```bash
/plugin install reflexion@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit
```

**Commands**

- `/reflexion:reflect` - Reflect on previous response and output, based on Self-refinement framework for iterative improvement with complexity triage and verification
- `/reflexion:memorize` - Memorize insights from reflections and updates CLAUDE.md file with this knowledge. Curates insights from reflections and critiques into CLAUDE.md using Agentic Context Engineering
- `/reflexion:critique` - Comprehensive multi-perspective review using specialized judges with debate and consensus building

#### Based on papers

Based on papers like [Self-Refine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12966) and [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366). These techniques improve the output of large language models by introducing feedback and refinement loops.

They are proven to **increase output quality by 8–21%** based on both automatic metrics and human preferences across seven diverse tasks, including dialogue generation, coding, and mathematical reasoning, when compared to standard one-step model outputs.

Full list of included patterns and techniques:

- [Self-Refinement / Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651) - One model generates, then reviews and improves its own output
- [Constitutional AI (CAI) / RLAIF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) - One model generates responses, another critiques them based on principles
- [Critic-Generator or Verifier-Generator Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12966) - Generator model creates outputs, Critic/verifier model evaluates and provides feedback
- [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) - One LLM evaluates/scores outputs from another LLM
- [Debate / Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325) - Multiple models propose and critique solutions
- [Generate-Verify-Refine (GVR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02424) - Three-stage process: generate → verify → refine based on verification

On top of that, the plugin is based on the [Agentic Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618) paper that uses memory updates after reflection, and **consistently outperforms strong baselines by 10.6%** on agents.

Also includes the following techniques:

- [Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13888) - Model generates answer, then verification questions, then revises
- [Tree of Thoughts (ToT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) - Explores multiple reasoning paths with evaluation
- [Process Reward Models (PRM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07633) - Evaluates reasoning steps rather than just final answers
